I"4 <p>No matter where you look, Zimbabwe is on the cusp of change. Robert Mugabe who has been in power since 18 April 1980 when the country gained its independence from Britain after a 15-year guerrilla war – first as Prime Minister and then as President from 1987 has now resigned. This is in the wake of a <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/879752/zimbabwe-coup-latest-news-live-updates-robert-Mugabe-grace-mugabe-military">military intervention</a> which <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/world/africa/2017/11/can-coup-zimbabwe-really-usher-democracy">saw tanks take to the streets of Harare</a> and assume control of national broadcasters. Consequently, the way has been cleared for Zimbabwe to step out of the shadow of its infamous ruler. Mugabe <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/heartbreak-harare-mugabe-fails-resign-171120054046184.html">initially resisted</a> to announce his much-anticipated resignation in an address on national TV. However under pressure, he has now agreed to step aside. What will the future look like for Zimbabwe?</p>

<p><strong>Echoes of history</strong></p>

<p>Zimbabwe’s 1980 independence was a moment of celebration for Zimbabweans and Africans. It came as a welcome respite to a war-torn populace. The general expectation of the black majority was that independence would usher prosperity. Fast forward to November 2017, a similar narrative of hope and renewal is beginning to unfold. Having endured 37 years of President Mugabe’s rule – punctuated by massive economic hardship – a military coup seems to have brought hope to the nation. The architects of the coup were in desperate need for legitimacy, and thus they sought support from the masses ostensibly to liberate them from Mugabe. Since many people were tired of Mugabe’s lengthy rule, thousands <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/17/anti-mugabe-protest-planned-in-harare-as-president-clings-on">took to the streets</a> to demand his departure. But what does this all mean?</p>

<p><strong>Filling the power vacuum</strong></p>

<p>To understand contemporary events in Zimbabwe we need to go back into history. The main protagonists in Zimbabwe’s war of independence were the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), led by Robert Mugabe, and the Zimbabwe African People’s Union (ZAPU) led by Joshua Nkomo. During the Rhodesian war, both parties had armed wings: the former had the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and the later had the Zimbabwe People’s Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA). The ZIPRA was based over the border in Zambia, receiving military assistance from the Soviet Union; while the ZANLA received military help from China and was based in Mozambique.</p>

<p>When the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jan/16/zimbabwe.chrismcgreal">Lancaster House Agreement</a> was signed in December 1979, demobilisation protocol was put into place as part of the settlement. Demobilisation itself faced many challenges, amplified by the unrealistic expectations of ex-combats hoping for a “good life” in return for their sacrifices. However, the conditions after independence turned out to be very different to what they had envisioned. A key feature being rampant unemployment. Feeling hard-done-by, ex-combatants became major players in independent Zimbabwe, using their status to gain power and excluding those who did not participate in the liberation struggle. As a result, the War Veterans Association was formed to represent the affairs of the ex-combatants.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in a bid to control post-war Zimbabwe, ZANU and ZAPU were often at each other’s throats. An attempt to unify them through the Popular Front in 1977 failed. Therefore, the two parties competed for power during the 1980 independence elections. Their animosity came to a head between 1983 and 1987. During this period, unrest in the Matabeleland region of the country  resulted in <a href="https://nehandaradio.com/2012/12/27/gukurahundi-massacres-number-of-victims-part-13/">the deaths of 3,750 people</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The current climate</strong></p>

<p>An incisive way of analysing the coup is through the lens of academic Norma Kriger. Viewed in this way, Zimbabwe’s military coup <a href="https://www.questia.com/library/120079194/guerrilla-veterans-in-post-war-zimbabwe-symbolic">should be seen in the context</a> of a “continuation of a political discourse about ‘authentic’ and ‘fake’ veterans that has been used by veterans and the party since 1980”. Unsurprisingly, therefore, General Chiwenga’s statement prior to the military takeover makes reference to “counter revolutionary infiltrators who are now effectively influencing the direction of the Party”. This narrative is meant to amplify the theme that those without battle credentials rank low in the chain of command. Whats more, such a claim is not without precedent. In the period immediately preceding the 2002 general election when ZANU PF faced election defeat, General Vitalis Zvinavashe proclaimed that: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1749933.stm">“We would not accept, let alone support or salute anyone with a different agenda”.</a> Zvinavashe’s statement was in reference to opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, who was widely tipped to win the election.</p>

<p><strong>Political infighting</strong></p>

<p>I argue therefore that the military action of 14 November was engendered by an internal conflict between ZANU PF factions: the military-aligned ‘Lacoste’ faction and the ‘G40’ group. What perhaps many did not realise is that as a de-facto organ of ZANU PF, the military was equally involved in the factional battle. Once again, General Chiwenga’s statement before the coup was telling. Specifically, it ordered that <a href="https://nehandaradio.com/2017/11/16/full-text-statement-general-constantino-chiwenga/">“the current purging, which is clearly targeting members of the party with a liberation background, must stop forthwith”</a>. Suffice it to say that the military is expected to remain apolitical in accordance with the constitution. It is thus ironic that any intra-party purging ought to have had any bearing on the actions of the army. If anything, the General’s statement confirmed that the military is a constituency of the ruling ZANU PF, and that it supports the Lacoste faction. In sum, the military coup was a battle for controlling ZANU PF. The clear message to be deduced from the military action at the very outset of the coup was that it is a key organ of ZANU PF.</p>

<p><strong>Who will emerge on top?</strong></p>

<p>In the coming weeks and months, the ZANU PF will likely bury the hatchet and emerge stronger. The euphoria of 18 November 2017 has already started to dissipate, much like how the elation of April 1980 fizzled away. Unlike 1980, this time Zimbabweans will realise that they were used as proxies in a factional fight. Zimbabwe is at a crossroads. Military veterans, seasoned political campaigners and the general citizenry are in constant struggle. It is difficult to imagine that the ZANU PF will manage these classes effectively. However, if it is to remain relevant, the ZANU PF needs to foment social and class harmony.</p>
