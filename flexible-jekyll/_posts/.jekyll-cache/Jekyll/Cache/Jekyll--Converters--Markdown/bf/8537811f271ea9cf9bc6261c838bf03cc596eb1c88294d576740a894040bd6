<p>On 25 July 2018, Samuel Shali Nghihepa, a sergeant in the Namibian Police Special Reserve Force Division, murdered his ex-girlfriend, Alina Kahehongo, in full view of her colleagues at a local supermarket in Windhoek, Namibia‚Äôs capital, before turning the gun on himself.</p>

<p>This is one of many cases of so-called [passion killings] (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-35705739) which have rocked the nation in the past few years. Dozens of such cases occur every year, in which women (primarily) are murdered by their lovers. This appalling incident has once again left many Namibians asking ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù, and has brought the Namibian police force under greater scrutiny.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, a 20-year-old man murdered five members of his family. In both instances the police had received tip-offs, but took no action.
One local radio DJ attributed this epidemic of brutal murders to some sort of mental illness. But perhaps it is Namibia‚Äôs social fabric that should be challenged; Namibia is often portrayed to the outside world as a success story, in large part due to its impressive stability compared to other countries in the region.</p>

<p>But even aside from these violent killings, Namibia still faces some extreme challenges, many of which are a legacy of an especially violent 20th century.</p>

<p><strong>The first genocide of the 20th century</strong></p>

<p>With the Black Lives Matter movement trending in the 21st century, one could argue that this was long overdue given the atrocities suffered by Africans at the height of colonial rule.</p>

<p>Between 1904 and 1908 German soldiers committed the first genocide of the 20th century. Led by General Lothar von Trotha, the German forces set out to annihilate the Ovahereros and Namas in southwestern Africa in a brutal war which involved poisoning water sources and the mass confiscation of property. The order given by the general in October 1904 belied his intention:</p>

<p>‚ÄúWithin German borders, every Herero, with or without a gun, with or without cattle, will be shot. I will no longer accept women and children, I will drive them back to their people or I will let them be shot at.‚Äù</p>

<p>Until August 2004, the German government had not officially apologised for these atrocities. Suffice it to say that the statement of apology made by the German Minister for Development and Economic Cooperation avoided directly using the term ‚Äògenocide‚Äô, conceding that at the time the word might have been appropriate, and referring instead to annihilation. To date, there has not been any agreement on the form of compensation to be provided by Germany to the victims‚Äô descendants.</p>

<p>After World War I, control of Namibia (then called South West Africa) passed to South Africa, which was given a mandate to administer the territory by the League of Nations until it was sufficiently prepared to act upon its own self-determination. South Africa interpreted this as an invitation to formally annex the territory and went on to rule it under a system of apartheid.</p>

<p><strong>Apartheid and independence</strong></p>

<p>South Africa held on to South West Africa for two reasons. Firstly, the vast mineral resources in the country were exploited for the benefit of white South Africans, and secondly Namibia provided a buffer from the guerrilla war which was raging in Angola between the Cuban-backed MPLA and the UNITA movement supported by South Africa Defence Force (SADF).</p>

<p>With growing opposition to South African rule, Namibians began to agitate for independence. An insurgent movement, the South West African People‚Äôs Organisation (SWAPO), was set up under the leadership of Sam Nujoma and began fighting what is commonly known as the South African Border War between 1966-90. With assistance from the USSR and China, the independence movement prevailed and Nujoma became the country‚Äôs first democratic president following the 1989 multi-party elections.</p>

<p>Since then, the SWAPO party has held power. President Hifikepunye Pohamba took over from Nujoma in 2005, and handed over to the incumbent, Hage Geingob, in 2015.</p>

<p><strong>Post-apartheid performance</strong></p>

<p>Despite, or perhaps because of, SWAPO‚Äôs record in bringing about independence from South Africa, the party has been criticised for abusing, torturing and detaining members suspected of spying for South Africa during the liberation struggle. In 2000, an organisation called Breaking the Walls of Silence released a list of 700 people which it alleged to have disappeared during the liberation struggle whilst in the hands of SWAPO.</p>
