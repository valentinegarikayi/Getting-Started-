I recently spent some time improving the typography of this blog. Here are the 3 things that had the biggest impact on improving my site&#8217;s readability.<!--more-->

### 1. Steal typography from sites that you like

Look at the sites you frequent and take note of their readability. Inspect their CSS of your favorites: Right-click > Inspect Element on the paragraph you like and steal their font-size, line-height, and paragraph width. 

This blog uses a 21px font-size &#038; 32px line-height when in full screen mode, which is a width of 665px. I took inspiration from Zeldman&#8217;s blog and SVN by 37 Signals.

### 2. Optimize your font stack for readability

Yes, thin Proxima Nova is gorgeous, but there’s a reason that books aren’t printed in it. Serif stacks are a lot more readable. 

Grab a serif font stack from [cssfontstack.com][1]. They are all optimized to fall back well across different browsers/devices. I’m a fan of the Cambria and Georgia stacks.

### 3. When in doubt, use the golden ratio

It&#8217;s argued that there’s a science to readability, and it’s the [golden ratio][2]. You really can’t go wrong with sticking to it. Pearsonified created a really handy [calculator][3] for calculating the golden ratio for your text.
