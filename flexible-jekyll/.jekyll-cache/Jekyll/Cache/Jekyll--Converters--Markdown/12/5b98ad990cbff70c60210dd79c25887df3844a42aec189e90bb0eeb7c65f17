I"å<p>In a prescient 2012 paper, Martin Dawson and Tim Kelsall suggested that hopes for better governance in Zimbabwe were nothing short of na√Øve.</p>

<p>Rather, the authors proposed that ‚Äúthe most powerful elite groups will realise that the old ways are unsustainable, and will seek to forge new institutional vehicles for consolidating and expanding rents with the assistance of an improved investment climate and re-professionalised bureaucracy‚Äù.</p>

<p>This has come to fruition, as the government ushered in by the November 2017 military operation has set out to unite, fight corruption, develop, re-engage and create jobs. Zimbabwe‚Äôs ruling Zimbabwe African National Union ‚Äì Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) party has a mixed record of efficient national rent-management, and therefore references to job creation, re-engagement and development all but conform Dawson and Kelsall‚Äôs proposition.</p>
